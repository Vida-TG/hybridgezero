<h3>Description</h3>
<p>HybridgeX is a multichain exchange that helps you swap tokens on two entirely different ecosystems. For example you can swap Avalanche's $JOE token directly to
ETH's $PEPE token. It does this by aggregating every DEX on the Avalanche to get  the best price to swap JOE to Circle's USDC after which the USDC is bridged to ETH USDC via Circle's CCTP and another price aggregation is performed to get the best price to swap the bridged USDC on ETH to $PEPE</p>
